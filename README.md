# MCA3
MCA3 build with PC

I asked Professor about how I should deal with this error I face since MCA1. I eventually could not fix it. So I was asked to submit the file with project zipped. 
I also zipped the pc built version in case. 
Please don't take points off for this. 
I spent my whole sunday to fix this webgl IL2cPP exception.
Also have my github Page.
